**Outline for Today**

Brief Intro to R Studio

Importing different formats of datasets (eg. CSV, Stata, SPSS, etc)

Basic cleaning tips such as re-coding of variables (factor to numeric & vice versa, creating new variables, handling missing values etc.)

Merging Datasets

Data Inspection and summary techniques

*Base R and Tidyverse examples for most objectives in this presentation. Be careful with how you proceed learning R. 


## **Basics of R**

This is an R Markdown document that will show you some of the basics of using the R language for data querying, data analysis, and we'll even get into some basics of graphics in R.

## Origins of R

R is a data querying language that was created by Bell Labs, and currently maintained and curated by the R Core Team at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.


**Comprehensive R Archived Network (CRAN)**

A system of "mirrors"

* Distributed network of servers around the world
* Request that you use the mirror geographically closest to you
* You can change your preferred mirror anytime

Closest CRAN mirror to UNC Charlotte: Duke University (even though Duke sucks, Go Heels!)

## **Installing R**

The first time you install R, you will install the **Base** package.

Has most of what you need to run standard statistics and most data querying procedures.

Other packages can be downloaded for more specific or specialized tasks:

* Graphics packages
* Advanced regression modeling
* Time series analysis
* Econometric methods
* Causal analysis
* Quasi-experimental methods

New versions of R are released every couple of months.

Names of R Versions are fun to watch.

* **How About a Twenty Six** (will releae 4-11-2025)
* "Trophy Case"
* "Pile of Lies"
* "Puppy Cup"
* "Angel Food Cake"
* "Shortstop Beagle"
* "Innocent and Trusting"
* "Funny Looking Kid"
* "Vigorous Calisthenics"



## RStudio

When working with R, you'll probably want to use **RStudio**, which is an IDE, or *"integrated development environment."*

* *Doesn't replace R!* 
* Must be used in conjunction with R.

R works by writing code and executing the code. 

RStudio just helps you to write that code and execute it properly.

It also let's you easily adjust things like color schemes, tile arrangement and so on.  

## Changing Options in RStudio

Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout

Tools > Global Options > Appearance

**The two main windows you need to be able to see?**

* **Console**
* **Source**

Make sure when you open RStudio that you have those two windows.

* You will write your commands in the **Source** window. Those commands form your R script. (input)

* When you execute those commands, the results will be shown in the **Console** window. (output)

The other window options:

Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer

* Helpful to show plots
* Shows any files you have open
* Shows results from help when you ask for it

Environment, History, Connections

* The main function here is that it shows you what objects are in R's memory
* Those are the objects you can do stuff with
* Gives you the option to import datasets, *but you don't need to use that option!*
* Later in this document (and at multiple other points), we'll see how to open data sets

## **Object Oriented Languages**

R is an an object oriented language

SPSS, SAS, and Stata are procedural languages

Generally, object oriented languages operate by creating or defining objects and then executing functions on those objects.

Objects can be:

* Single numbers (i.e. scalars)
* Single character strings (e.g. "Hello, World!")
* Vectors (like, a single variable)
* Matrices
* Data Frames

Most of the data sets you'll work with will be **data frames**.

Objects have attributes:

* Length
* Class (numeric, integrer, character, matrix, data frame)

Which functions you can execute on those objects depends on the class, and sometimes the length.

## Creating Objects

The name you give an object is *completely arbitrary* and totally up to you.

Words of advice when naming objects:

* Dynamic language
* R is case-sensitive!!!
* You may have to type the object's name a *bunch*
* Easy to remember what it is

**Okay. Let's create a few objects.**

First, a character string.

```{r}
x <- "Hello, World!"  # Doesn't generate output, just creates the object, "x""
print(x)  # Executes the print() function on the object, "x"
```

**R as a big calculator**

```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 7
x+y
```

*Notice how I created an object called "x" again? Because R is dynamic, it replaced the old contents with the new contents automatically.* 

**Attributes of Objects**

```{r}
class(y)
length(y)
```

## **WRITING SCRIPTS**

In R, you will want to write scripts that store the code you write.

The code is the "input" - tells the computer what to do

No need to save the output if you save the input.

In RStudio, you'll write these in the "Source" pane.

You can save them as .R files.



## **Opening Data**

R can be used to open data stored in a variety of file types

* Excel spreadsheets
* SPSS .sav files
* Text files
* Files from the internet, like JSON or HTML files

Most common - the **Comma Separated Value (.csv)** file

You'll use the read.csv() function to open these kinds of files.

This function simply reads the contents of a CSV file. 

You'll also need to create an object, and then pass the contents of the CSV file to that object.

> data <- read.csv(file.choose(),header=TRUE)

This code, when used in an R script, would allow you to open data.

The **file.choose()** option just tells R to open a file explorer window where you can manually specify which file you want to open.  The **header=TRUE** option tells R that the first row of the data file is not actual data, but rather is a header containing the names of the variables.

If you don't use the file.choose() option, you'll have to specify the file path, which you can do, but can be cumbersome.

In this file, you'll see me use specific file names, because I can't use the file.choose() option in an R Markdown file. But that's okay, don't worry about it. When you're running RStudio normally, you can use it all you like.

Anywho, go ahead and open the data files I sent you. The code will look like this, except without the "#" at the beginning.




The first thing we are going to do is install and read in libraries we will use. 

```{r}
# library(readxl)
# library(lubridate)
library(foreign)
# library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
# library(readstata13)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
# library(jpeg)
# library(forcats)
```

## Setting Up the Environment

```{r}
# Check the working directory
getwd()

```

Change your working directory to *this* directory by going to:

1. Session (in the top menu bar) 
2. Set Working Directory >  
3. To Source File Location 

## Loading Data

### Read in Governors Race and Gender Data

```{r}
Governors_race_gender <- read_csv("Governors_race_gender.csv")
head(Governors_race_gender)
```

### Read in Gubernatorial Winners Vote Data

```{r}
gubernatorial_winners_vote <- read_dta("gubernatorial_winners_vote.dta")
```

### Read in Governor Approval Annual Data

```{r}
SEAD_governor_annual_v1 <- read_dta("SEAD governor annual v1.dta")
head(SEAD_governor_annual_v1)
```

### Read in State Abbreviations

```{r}
stateabbs2 <- read_dta("stateabbs2.dta")
head(stateabbs2)
```

### Read in State Mood Data

```{r}
mood_nyt <- read_excel("mood_nyt.xls")
head(mood_nyt)
```


## Standardizing Column Names

```{r}
# Convert column names to lowercase for consistency
names(Governors_race_gender) <- tolower(names(Governors_race_gender))
names(gubernatorial_winners_vote) <- tolower(names(gubernatorial_winners_vote))
names(SEAD_governor_annual_v1) <- tolower(names(SEAD_governor_annual_v1))
names(stateabbs2) <- tolower(names(stateabbs2))
names(mood_nyt) <- tolower(names(mood_nyt))
```

## Verify Column Name Consistency
```{r}
# Check the names of all datasets to confirm standardization
names(Governors_race_gender)
names(gubernatorial_winners_vote)
names(SEAD_governor_annual_v1)
names(stateabbs2)
names(mood_nyt)
```
```{r}
# Rename 'statename' to 'state' in mood_nyt dataset
mood_nyt <- mood_nyt %>% rename(state = statename)
mood_nyt <- mood_nyt %>% rename(abb = cstate_initial)

head(mood_nyt)
```



## Merging Data by State and Year
```{r}
# Perform sequential left joins to merge all datasets on state and year
merged_data <- Governors_race_gender %>%
  left_join(gubernatorial_winners_vote, by = c("state", "year")) %>%
  left_join(SEAD_governor_annual_v1, by = c("state", "year")) %>%
  left_join(stateabbs2, by = "state") %>%  # Merging state abbreviations (no year match required)
  left_join(mood_nyt, by = c("state", "year"))
```

## Preview Merged Data
```{r}
glimpse(merged_data)
head(merged_data)
```
Notice some of the variables we may want to use as a numeric value are stored as characters. That is OK, we can pick variables we want numeric and change the data format. 

```{r}
merged_data$race<-as.factor(merged_data$race)

head(merged_data)

```




## Referencing the contents of your data frame.

Variables are stored inside this data frame. You can reference the variables by name, using the **$** operator. 
Here's how it works.

Let's say you want to ask for summary statistics on gubernatorial voteshare in the American states. 

Inside the "merged_data" data frame, there is a variable called "voteshare".

We just need to ask R to show us some summary statistics on that variable.

We'll use the summary() function to do so. 

```{r}
summary(merged_data$voteshare)
```

Or, maybe you wanted to know the mean and standard deviation of the winner totals in North Carolina

Good thing there are functions to help us do that.

```{r}
# Filter the dataset for North Carolina and summarize 'voteshare'


nc_voteshare_stats <- summary(merged_data[merged_data$state=="North Carolina","voteshare"])


# Display the summary
print(nc_voteshare_stats)
summary(merged_data$voteshare)

```
What if we want to make new variables based on the ones we already have?

Let’s make a categorical variable that bins the voteshare in the states into ranges.

First, let’s look at how the voteshares are distributed.

```{r}
voteshare <- merged_data$voteshare

table(voteshare)
```


```{r}
votebin<-vector()
length(votebin)<-length(voteshare)
votebin[voteshare >= 0 & voteshare < 50] <- "1. 0-50"
votebin[voteshare >= 50 & voteshare < 60] <- "2. 50-60"
votebin[voteshare >= 60] <- "3. 60+"
table(votebin)
```

```{r}
class(votebin)
```

```{r}
votebin<-as.factor(votebin)

class(votebin)
```
```{r}
plot(votebin)

```  

Here is a full example, using the Tidy approach that adds the created variable directly to our dataset.
```{r}


summary(merged_data$approval_smoothed)
hist(merged_data$approval_smoothed)

# Create variable within merged_data
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(approval_bin = case_when(
    approval_smoothed >= 0 & approval_smoothed < 50 ~ "Unpopular",
    approval_smoothed >= 50  ~ "Popular",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Handles cases where approval is NA or doesn't fit any range
  ))

# Display the frequency table of votebin
table(merged_data$approval_bin)




# Create a bar plot of votebin categories
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = approval_bin)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Approval Bin Categories",
    x = "Approval Categories",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
